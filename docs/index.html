<h1>Greedy Algorithms</h1>

<p>

In the graphs shown, there are 4 different ε-greedy methods (at ε = 0.2, ε = 0.1, ε = 0.01, ε = 0.0) 
on a 10-armed testbed. There are a total of 10000 steps in the experiment, and the results are averaged over 10 runs. 
The 10 different reward distributions have a mean of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5, respectively. 

The total regret is also graphed for the different values of ε.

<p>
The difference between this and the graph given in the book is that the 10 arms have distributions ranging from [0,5) in increments of 0.5. 
The book did not specify the exact average rewards for each of the arms, it only mentioned the best possible scenario of 1.55. 
Also, the book started off with an initial action-value estimate of 0, although it starts at a step of 1.
 I did not quite understand this since it means you are assuming the reward for the first arm selection would be 0. 
 For the second graph, I chose to use total regret instead of percent optimal value as an indication for how well the algorithm is performing, rather than the percent optimal action. 
 In my graph shown, lower epsilon values tended to yield higher total regret so this would indicate a lower percent optimal action, which is reflected in the graph in the book
